I’m happy, relieved and really looking forward to it - the contract runs until the end of December.</p><p>Which may actually work out really nicely, as I’ve been looking lately at the possibility of applying for <a href="http://devacademy.co.nz/">Enspiral Dev Academy.</a> The more time I spend writing code, finding frameworks, learning design patterns, the more I’m wondering whether I would really love working in software dev. But I don’t want to go back to uni for another three years - instead, packing up and living back in Wellington for three months in the new year, being challenged every day and putting in a TON of work sounds like it could be an amazing route into the industry<sup id=fnlink1 class=footnote-link><a href=#fn1>1</a></sup>.</p><p>I’m going to try and blog more so that I can look back and see my progress in this kind of self-directed learning. This doesn’t come that easily - I’m naturally shy of putting things out to the world before I think they’re ‘finished’, which is a bad habit that I’ve been inspired to try and break. It’s been all too easy to believe the myth of the <a href="http://joshldavis.com/2014/06/13/put-yourself-out-there/">genius programmer</a> / artist.</p><p>So, to kick it off in a small way, I’ve been watching the iOS lecture series from Stanford that is <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-7-apps-for/id733644550>freely available</a> on iTunes U. I’m not following along with building the same apps the class has to create - rather, I’m trying to take the concepts and make little apps of my own that show them off.</p><p>I have one working so far! It covers some of the stuff shown in the first six or so lectures. Dead simple when it’s used - just a single button which greets you with “hello” in a random language, and a second screen which shows which languages you have seen so far.</p><p>But it covers a lot! Multiple MVC’s, a segue which passes data, basic OOP principles. The repo is <a href=https://github.com/iainkirkpatrick/RandomGreeting>here</a> - again, I’m sure it could be more elegantly put together, but I’ll get better! The most difficult learning curve so far has actually been adapting to static typing, and generally just having to be WAY more specific structurally than when working with JS and Python. I’m finding that kind of cool though, I feel like it’s slowly giving me a better understanding of good practices and OOP efficiencies.</p><p>Though sometimes I swear you just want to write a damn variable assignment and let Xcode suss it out! Roll on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>!</p></div><div class=col-sm-4><!-- <small>Sidebar Footnotes.</small> --><small class=footnote id=fn1>1.
